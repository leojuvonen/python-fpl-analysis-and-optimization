# python-fantasy-football-analysis

This project shows my journey into learning Python for data analysis using football data from Fantasy Premier League. I explore the significance of various variables within the dataset, ultimately culminating in the development of an optimized team selection strategy.

## Overview
The project consists of the tabulation of players in different positions. We'll also examine the top players in terms on price to total points ratio, influence, creativity and threat (ICT). 
Then we will analyze which of the ICT-variables predict total points the best, meaning which one of them is the most essential to look at. Then the age old question of, whether defenders should be picked based on goals and assists or clean sheets, will be assessed. 

## Tools
The tool used in this project is Python. This analysis is mainly designed to help me familiarize Python and it's capabilities in data analysis. The packages used are pandas, statsmodels and matplotlib.

## Data source
The data used in this analysis is from vaastav's Github: https://github.com/vaastav/Fantasy-Premier-League/
